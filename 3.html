<h2>Story of New York  타임 스퀘어</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target ="_blank" title ="html specification">I got a new office</a> near<strong> <u>Bryant</u> park</strong>. It has an air conditioner and table to seat. I don't have to worry about the cost of internet. It also has a free wi-fi. Actually, it is a public space in American bank building. Whatever, it provides the best place to do something. I'm going to think about what should I do during the time I stayed in New York.
'oh..... they have a wi-fi , but it's not working very well'

<p style="margin -top :60px;">I came  to New work a month ago with fantasy. What I thought was nice things will be happened as I watched in the movies. The reality is ,however. rather different. The impression of New York city faded out in two weeks. Even if it looks cool and fabulous, it was a short moment. I have to worry about the cost of living expenses. What I eat what I wear what I use. It makes me crazy. The most difficult thing of which is a socialize. Actually, my plan was hang out with my friends together after the end of classes, but classmates who take same class were so busy to go somewhere. Most of them said that they have job to go or have something to do. They came here quite long time ago, so they have to work to afford their living expense. So, I have to just walk along the street by doing meaningless things. As time passed, everything in New York makes me boring then I think I want to go back to my country.

  Times Square is a major commercial intersection, tourist destination, entertainment center and neighborhood in the Midtown Manhattan section of New York City at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue. It stretches from West 42nd to West 47th Streets.[1] Brightly adorned with billboards and advertisements, Times Square is sometimes referred to as "The Crossroads of the World",[2] "The Center of the Universe",[3] "the heart of The Great White Way",[4][5][6] and the "heart of the world".[7] One of the world's busiest pedestrian areas,[8] it is also the hub of the Broadway Theater District[9] and a major center of the world's entertainment industry.[10] Times Square is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, drawing an estimated 50 million visitors annually.[11] Approximately 330,000 people pass through Times Square daily,[12] many of them tourists,[13] while over 460,000 pedestrians walk through Times Square on its busiest days.[7]

Formerly known as Longacre Square, Times Square was renamed in 1904 after The New York Times moved its headquarters to the then newly erected Times Building – now One Times Square – the site of the annual New Year's Eve ball drop which began on December 31, 1907, and continues today, attracting over a million visitors to Times Square every year.[14][15]

Times Square functions as a town square, but is not geometrically a square; it is closer in shape to a bowtie, with two triangles emanating roughly north and south from 45th Street,[16] where Seventh Avenue intersects Broadway. Broadway runs diagonally, crossing through the horizontal and vertical street grid of Manhattan laid down by the Commissioners' Plan of 1811, and that intersection creates the "bowtie" shape of Times Square.[17]

The southern triangle of Times Square has no specific name,[18] but the northern triangle is called Father Duffy Square. It was dedicated in 1937 to Chaplain Francis P. Duffy of New York City's U.S. 69th Infantry Regiment and is the site of a memorial to him, along with a statue of George M. Cohan,[19] as well as the TKTS reduced-price ticket booth run by the Theatre Development Fund. Since 2008, the booth has been backed by a red, sloped, triangular set of bleacher-like stairs, which is used by people to sit, talk, eat, and take photographs.
