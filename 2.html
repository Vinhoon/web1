<h2>Story of New York 뉴욕 이야기</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/" target ="_blank" title ="html specification">I got a new office</a> near<strong> <u>Bryant</u> park</strong>. It has an air conditioner and table to seat. I don't have to worry about the cost of internet. It also has a free wi-fi. Actually, it is a public space in American bank building. Whatever, it provides the best place to do something. I'm going to think about what should I do during the time I stayed in New York.
'oh..... they have a wi-fi , but it's not working very well'

<p style="margin -top :60px;">I came  to New work a month ago with fantasy. What I thought was nice things will be happened as I watched in the movies. The reality is ,however. rather different. The impression of New York city faded out in two weeks. Even if it looks cool and fabulous, it was a short moment. I have to worry about the cost of living expenses. What I eat what I wear what I use. It makes me crazy. The most difficult thing of which is a socialize. Actually, my plan was hang out with my friends together after the end of classes, but classmates who take same class were so busy to go somewhere. Most of them said that they have job to go or have something to do. They came here quite long time ago, so they have to work to afford their living expense. So, I have to just walk along the street by doing meaningless things. As time passed, everything in New York makes me boring then I think I want to go back to my country.
